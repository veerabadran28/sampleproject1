You are an expert financial analyst. I need a comparative analysis of Tata, Tesla, and Citi banks in a specific Python dictionary format. 

Please provide your analysis ONLY in this exact Python dictionary format, with no additional text or explanations:

data = {
    "Bank": ["Tata", "Tesla", "Citi"],
    "Common Patterns & Trends": [
        # First string for Tata's trends
        # Second string for Tesla's trends
        # Third string for Citi's trends
    ],
    "Relative Performance": [
        # First string for Tata's performance metrics
        # Second string for Tesla's performance metrics
        # Third string for Citi's performance metrics
    ],
    "Key Insights": [
        # First string for Tata's key insights
        # Second string for Tesla's key insights
        # Third string for Citi's key insights
    ],
    "Forward Looking Analysis": [
        # First string for Tata's future analysis
        # Second string for Tesla's future analysis
        # Third string for Citi's future analysis
    ]
}

Requirements:
1. Format must be exactly as shown above
2. Each analysis point must be a single string with multiple insights separated by periods
3. Include specific numbers and metrics where relevant
4. Keep each string concise but informative
5. Provide latest relevant insights for each category
6. Do not include any other text, comments, or explanations
7. Do not include the hash symbols or comments shown in the template above
